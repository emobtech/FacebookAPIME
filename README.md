# FacebookAPIME
Facebook API ME defines a compelling and well defined API for Java developers who wish to access Facebook's services. This project provides support for the main and more popular services, e.g., status posting, friends list, etc. More services are added as new versions are released. Facebook API ME is defined in such a way that developers will learn how to use it quickly. In addition, the API is structured to work regardless of the underlying Java platform (e.g. Java ME, Android and RIM), in order to make easier and quicker for the developers to port their applications to other platforms.
